// You descend from the Antechamber into a circular stone chamber. A black
// well sits in the center. Beside it: the Bestiary tablet.

// Read this file. You will not edit it. Its job is to parse commands the
// player types and dispatch to the functions YOU wrote in Search.cpp.
// This is the "seam" pattern: every CLI command ultimately calls one of
// your four functions through Search.h. Nothing else knows about them.
// That decoupling is worth more than the search algorithm itself.
